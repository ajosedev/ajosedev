# Heya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for the frontend. Currently deep diving into the design system world.

I enjoy building interactive and interesting products to innovate, inform, assist, unite, solve, and so much more.

I don't do much on my public GitHub, but I occasionally make small side projects or write snippets on CodePen.
