# Heya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for design systems, frontend development, and making things look beautiful. I've worked on all areas front to back, and am now focusing on the finer details of UI - leading a design system team to make products shine for users. Love working across disciplines with designers, product, and other engineers and bringing out the best of those around me.
